# US Tariff Shocks – Event Study Analysis

This repository contains the event study framework used to 
estimate abnormal stock returns of Indian firms around major 
U.S. tariff announcement dates.

## Objective
To measure short-term financial market reactions to tariff 
policy shocks and assess how exposure to U.S. trade affected 
firm valuation.

## Methodology

1. Event Study Framework
   - Identification of key tariff announcement dates
   - Estimation window and event window construction
   - Expected return modeling

2. Abnormal Return Estimation
   - Market model / CAPM specification
   - Calculation of abnormal returns (AR)
   - Cumulative abnormal returns (CAR)

3. Cross-Sectional Analysis
   - Exposure-based heterogeneity
   - Sector-level comparison

## Output
- Abnormal return plots
- Cumulative abnormal return tables
- Statistical significance tests
